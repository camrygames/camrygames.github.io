Welcome to my blog! Here I put things about me and my life.
My name is Camry. I am a 10 year-old boy who loves to build and play games. I enjoy exercising, and I love to play sports including basketball, soccer, volleyball, kickball, and track. I enjoy spending time with my family, whether it's going to an amusement park, visiting a zoo, or watching a funny tv show, most of the time I like their company. I also like to code and boy, this was a challenge. You can visit me on Youtube.
